## 🖋️ Handwritten Notes

I'm dedicating time daily to master these topics and am using this space to upload my handwritten notes for each lecture in the `handwritten-notes/` folder. These provide raw insights and quick recall visuals straight from my study sessions.

This will help me:
- Track my consistency and growth
- Maintain a record of my **handwritten notes** alongside lecture-wise topics
