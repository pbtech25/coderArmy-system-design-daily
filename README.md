# 🛠️ Coder Army - System Design Daily

Welcome to my **Coder Army - System Design Daily** repository!  

This repo documents my day-by-day learning journey of **System Design**, based on tutorials taught by [**Aditya Tandon Sir**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityatandon2?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3B31XYqLkHQouiNrxhKfF4Qg%3D%3D) on the [**Coder Army**](https://www.youtube.com/@CoderArmy9) YouTube channel (run by Rohit Negi Sir). It includes core concepts, architecture breakdowns, diagrams, handwritten notes, and practical case studies.

## 🖋️ Handwritten Notes

I'm dedicating time daily to master these topics and am using this space to upload my handwritten notes for each lecture here: [System Design - Handwritten Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cV_IFmY8QthZJlH6pEF55RqlN1r5t-r8?usp=sharing) folder. 

> ⚠️ Note: You can always find lecture-wise handwritten notes from Daily Progress Log's clickable link!


This will help me:
- Track my consistency and growth
- Maintain a record of my **handwritten notes** alongside lecture-wise topics
